# MyFarmingHole

FarmingHole is a 2D farming simulator that allows the player to build his own small farm.

The place of action is the colorful, lively FarmingHole Island. Here the player can grow crops on fields and harvest them after a certain growing period. Later, the grain stored in the silo or trailer can be sold in the store. Of course, the tank of the vehicle used must be taken into account. If the tank should be empty, the player can also pick up a "canister" directly at the gas station and refuel his vehicle with it. If there is no more money available, the game is over.

The goal of the game is to earn enough money to purchase the bridge located at the southern end of the island to rebuild the connection to the mainland.
